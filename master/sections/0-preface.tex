\chapter*{Preface}

I would like to thank my supervisors, PhD candidate Johannes HÃ¸ydahl Jensen and
professor Gunnar Tufte, for helpful feedback and encouragement. It has been a
pleasure.

I would also like to thank PhD candidate Peter Aaser for kindly introducing me
to the world of complex systems. It has been a stimulating endeavor, and has
become an interest that will last me a lifetime.
