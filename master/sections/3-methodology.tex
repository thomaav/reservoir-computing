\chapter{Methodology}

Introduce the baseline Echo State Network that we used, and what types of
training data we used for offline training and so on.

Should we split experiments into multiple sections that all have their own
little mini-IMRAD? Could be helpful to first finish everything related to Waxman
model graphs, finish the discussion, and then lead further on to lattices.

Anyway: for each experiment, describe the experimental setup that was used such
that it may \textit{easily be reproduced}. It has been very helpful when papers
actually provide every relevant parameter such that I could run the experiments
myself.
