\chapter*{Abstract}

Reservoir computing has become a predominant member of the unconventional
computing paradigm. It is a framework suited for processing of temporal and
sequential data, traditionally using recurrent neural network models to
incorporate past inputs into an instantaneous readout.

Interestingly, there is no need for the reservoir to be an artificial neural
network -- any high-dimensional, driven system exhibiting complex dynamic
behavior can be used. A wide range of physical substrates have been proposed as
reservoir machines, ranging from nanomagnetic assemblies to living cultures of
neurons.

A major challenge when realizing physical reservoirs is the physical limitations
present in the underlying substrate. This is in contrast to abstract model
reservoirs, e.g. echo state networks, which have no physical constraints in
regards to dimensionality, spatial layout and observability. In this thesis, we
investigate reservoirs with realistic dimensional and spatial properties,
constraining the possibility of making structural changes. Initially, we conduct
experiments with echo state networks that consist of random geometric graphs,
the simplest spatial network model. We the further this work with lattice
structures, which are highly regular architectures, and are common in
computational physics.

Results show that spatial constraints by default inhibit the NARMA-10 benchmark
performance of both models. However, introducing directed edges to the network
instead of bidirectional ones restore performance to compete with established
models, indicating that the flow of information is an important property in
quality reservoirs.

Furthermore, simple square lattice reservoirs with a fixed, global input are
found to perform as well as echo state networks on NARMA-10 and Mackey-Glass
benchmarks. The value of regular, deterministic structures as a tool for
theoretical analysis is evaluated, giving examples of methodology to explore the
inner workings of networks when solving specific tasks.
