* DONE Add image of output connectivity (scatter plot ish, to see difference when more hidden nodes).
* DONE Write about this output connectivity stuff above.
* TODO Write about output connectivity in the context of information processing.
* TODO Write about Chua diode, and the impact of noise that is hard to characterize.
* TODO Change quantization image to bit size on x-axis. Change the x-axis length.
* TODO Write about Shannon information stuff for noise to replace current WiFi stuff.
* DONE Make a table of simulation setup.
* TODO Use ridge regression.
* DONE Talk about how quantization is very reliant on _where_ in the range values lie, e.g. tanh.
