\begin{abstract}
  We explore the impact of limitations present in physical Reservoir Computing
(RC). In recent years a wide range of physical reservoirs have been realized,
ranging from optical laser circuits and nanomagnetic assemblies to biological
neural networks. The computational performance of such physical substrates is
likely to be closely related to common physical limitations, e.g. noise,
measurement accuracy, partially visible reservoir state, and physical
morphology. Here we investigate fundamental properties of physical reservoirs
using Echo State Network (ESN) simulations, offering insights into impairments
resulting from such limitations.

We find reservoirs to be very robust to noisy inputs. Furthermore, we observe
that ADCs with 12 bits of resolution are sufficient to represent reservoir
dynamics well. Finally, we suggest approaches to reservoir perturbation and
observation, most importantly discovering that information may be completely
lost with output sampling that is too sparse. Our findings fill several
knowledge gaps in the field of physical reservoir realization, which in the
wider context help improve the design of future substrates.
