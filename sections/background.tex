This is the background. This should primarily be on Echo State Networks in practice.

1. How ESNs work.
2. Time series, specifically NARMA and NARMA10.
3. Ridge regression, pseudo inverse, how it's done.

Cite practical guide to ESNs.

Evaluation of ESN performance on NARMA10 has been done in: An experimental unification of reservoir computing methods, Minimum Complexity Echo State Networks, Adaptive Nonlinear System Identification with Echo State Networks.
